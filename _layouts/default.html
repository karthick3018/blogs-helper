    <h2> What Blogs helper solves ?</h2>
    
    The Problem statement I took was simple and weird , not sure how many of them faced it but to be honest I faced a lot.
    
    While reading the technical blogs there will be a code snipet at the starting of the blog which will be referenced
    and explained till the bottom of the blogs. As we go on scrolling the page the actual code snipet which is referenced
    will be hidden in the viewport.
    
    Now while reading the explanation I've forgot the actual code snipet.
    
    <i>What is this blog explaining ðŸ¤”</i>
    
    So to overcome that I've used multiple window one for the code snipet and other one is for the explanation . This is not
    the perfect way right ? Why not stickys ? Not sure how to use without minimizing the browser. So to overcome that I've
    made Blogs helper.

    <h3> Features</h3>
    
    * It will stick to the right side of the window . Since most of the sites have blank space at the right.
    * It can resize to a particular width & height.
    * It can be dragged and moved around the particular right side area.
